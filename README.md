# ProjectOne


What the project is:
It's a simulation of a beerpong game, except one on one and dinosaur themed.

Why I made it:
I'm always looking for funny things to send to my friends and I thought they'd appreciate this. 
It also helped me work on some collision and animation things I wasn't exposed to prior.

 
 
Explanations of the technologies used:
I used HTML to build the page, JavaScript to run it, CSS to style the page, and Jquiery to go between everything.

The approach taken:
I made the board first, and then made the ball and used margin comparisons and CSS animation to see if the ball made it into the cup. 
Aside from that there's lots of buttons and conditionals.


Unsolved problems:
Some of the animation could've been cooler, I didn't really figure out how to use Velocity. There were different things I could've added like islands
but overall I'm happy with how it turned out.
